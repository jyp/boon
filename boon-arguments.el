;;; boon-arguments.el --- An Ergonomic Command Mode  -*- lexical-binding: t -*-

;;; Commentary:

;; This file defines functions which are intended to be used as
;; 'interactive' specifications: `boon-spec-select-top' and
;; `boon-spec-enclosure'.  These are used by boon commands, but can be
;; used by any commands.
;;
;; In this module can also be found functions which are bound in
;; `boon-select-map'.  Those functions return a no-argument lambda which
;; returns a list of boon-regs.
